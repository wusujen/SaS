		"Protein is found in the following foods: meats, poultry, and fish; legumes (dry beans and peas); tofu; eggs; nuts and seeds; milk and milk products;"
				+ "grains, some vegetables, and some fruits (provide only small amounts of protein relative to other sources). \n \n"
				+ "As we mentioned, most adults in the United States get more than enough protein to meet their needs. It's rare for someone "
				+ "who is healthy and eating a varied diet to not get enough protein. \n \nProteins are made up of amino acids. Think of amino acids "
				+ "as the building blocks. There are 20 different amino acids that join together to make all types of protein. Some of these amino acids"
				+ " can't be made by our bodies, so these are known as essential amino acids. It's essential that our diet provide these. \n\nIn the diet, protein"
				+ " sources are labeled according to how many of the essential amino acids they provide. A complete protein source is one that provides all of "
				+ "the essential amino acids. You may also hear these sources called high quality proteins. For example, meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, "
				+ "and cheese are considered complete protein sources.\n\nAn incomplete protein source is one that is low in one or more of the essential"
				+ " amino acids. Complementary proteins are two or more incomplete protein sources that together provide adequate amounts of all the essential "
				+ "amino acids.";

		nutrientDescriptions[3] = // => total fats
		"Dietary fats are found in both plant and animal foods. Fats supply calories and essential fatty acids, "
				+ "and help in the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fatty acids are categorized as being saturated, "
				+ "monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated. Fats contain a mixture of these different kinds of fatty acids. Trans "
				+ "fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids. However, they are structurally different from the predominant "
				+ "unsaturated fatty acids that occur naturally in plant foods and have dissimilar health effects. ";

		nutrientDescriptions[4] = // => carbohydrates
		"Your body uses carbohydrates (carbs) to make glucose which is the fuel that gives you energy and helps keep everything going. Your body can use "
				+ "glucose immediately or store it in your liver and muscles for when it is needed. You can find carbohydrates in the following: fruits, vegetables,"
				+ "breads, cereals, other grains, milk and milk products and foods containing added sugars (e.g., cakes, cookies, and sugar-sweetened beverages). \n \n"
				+ "Healthier foods higher in carbohydrates include ones that provide dietary fiber and whole grains as well as those without added sugars. What about "
				+ "foods higher in carbohydrates such as sodas and candies that also contain added sugars? Those are the ones that add extra calories "
				+ "but not many nutrients to your diet. \n\nYour best approach is to follow a meal plan that gives you 45% to 65% of the calories as carbohydrates.";

		nutrientDescriptions[5] = // => fiber
		"You may have seen dietary fiber on the label listed as soluble fiber or insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is found in the following: Oatmeal; Oat bran;"
				+ "Nuts and seeds; Most fruits (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, pears, and apples); Dry beans and peas. Insoluble fiber found in the following: "
				+ "Whole wheat bread; Barley; Brown rice; Couscous; Bulgur or whole grain cereals; Wheat bran; Seeds; Most vegetables; Fruits. \n\n"
				+ "Which type is best? Both! Each has important health benefits so eat a variety of these foods to get enough of both. You're "
				+ "also more likely to get other nutrients that you might miss if you just chose 1 or 2 high-fiber foods. It's recommended that you get 14 grams "
				+ "of dietary fiber for every 1,000 calories that you consume each day. If you need 2,000 calories each day, you should try to include 28 grams of dietary fiber.";

		nutrientDescriptions[6] = // => sugar
		"Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables milk, and milk products. Simple carbohydrates also include sugars "
				+ "added during food processing and refining.4 What's the difference? In general, foods with added sugars have fewer nutrients than foods with "
				+ "naturally-occurring sugars. If you see any of these in the ingredient list, you know the food has added sugars."
				+ " The closer to the top of the list, the more of that sugar is in the food. ";

		nutrientDescriptions[7] = // => calcium
		"Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some "
				+ "medicines (such as antacids). Calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular"
				+ "calcium is very tightly regulated and does not fluctuate with changes in dietary intakes; the body uses bone tissue as a reservoir for, and source "
				+ "of calcium, to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in blood, muscle, and intercellular fluids. \n\nThe remaining 99% of the body's calcium "
				+ "supply is stored in the bones and teeth where it supports their structure and function. Bone itself undergoes continuous remodeling, with constant"
				+ " resorption and deposition of calcium into new bone. The balance between bone resorption and deposition changes with age. Bone formation exceeds "
				+ "resorption in periods of growth in children and adolescents, whereas in early and middle adulthood both processes are relatively equal. "
				+ "In aging adults, particularly among postmenopausal women, bone breakdown exceeds formation, resulting in bone loss that increases the risk of "
				+ "osteoporosis over time. \n\nMilk, yogurt, and cheese are rich natural sources of calcium and are the major food contributors of this nutrient to "
				+ "people in the United States [1]. Nondairy sources include vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Spinach provides calcium, but"
				+ " its bioavailability is poor. Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified; however, they contribute calcium to the "
				+ "diet because they contain small amounts of calcium and people consume them frequently. Foods fortified with calcium include many fruit juices and "
				+ "drinks, tofu, and cereals.";

		nutrientDescriptions[8] = // => iron
		"Iron, one of the most abundant metals on Earth, is essential to most life forms and to normal human physiology. Iron is an integral part of many proteins"
				+ " and enzymes that maintain good health. In humans, iron is an essential component of proteins involved in oxygen transport. It is also essential for "
				+ "the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. A deficiency of iron limits oxygen delivery to cells, resulting in fatigue, poor work performance, "
				+ "and decreased immunity. On the other hand, excess amounts of iron can result in toxicity and even death. \n\nThere are two forms of dietary iron: "
				+ "heme and nonheme. Heme iron is derived from hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells. Heme iron is found in animal "
				+ "foods that originally contained hemoglobin, such as red meats, fish, and poultry. Iron in plant foods such as lentils and beans is arranged in a "
				+ "chemical structure called nonheme iron. This is the form of iron added to iron-enriched and iron-fortified foods. Heme iron is absorbed better "
				+ "than nonheme iron, but most dietary iron is nonheme iron. A variety of heme and nonheme sources of iron are listed in Tables 1 and 2.";

		nutrientDescriptions[9] = // => magnesium
		"Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone."
				+ " The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard "
				+ "to keep blood levels of magnesium constant. Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle "
				+ "and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar "
				+ "levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest "
				+ "in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed "
				+ "in the small intestines. Magnesium is excreted through the kidneys. \n\nGreen vegetables such as spinach are good sources of magnesium because the "
				+ "center of the chlorophyll molecule (which gives green vegetables their color) contains magnesium. Some legumes (beans and peas), nuts and seeds, and "
				+ "whole, unrefined grains are also good sources of magnesium. Refined grains are generally low in magnesium. When white flour is refined and "
				+ "processed, the magnesium-rich germ and bran are removed. Bread made from whole grain wheat flour provides more magnesium than bread made from white "
				+ "refined flour. Tap water can be a source of magnesium, but the amount varies according to the water supply. Water that naturally contains more minerals "
				+ "is described as \'hard\'. \'Hard\' water contains more magnesium than \'soft\' water. Eating a wide variety of legumes, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables"
				+ " will help you meet your daily dietary need for magnesium.";

		nutrientDescriptions[10] = // => potassium
		"";

		nutrientDescriptions[11] = // => sodium
		"Sodium is an essential nutrient and is needed by the body in relatively small quantities, provided that "
				+ "substantial sweating does not occur. On average, the higher an individual\'s sodium intake, "
				+ "the higher the individual\'s blood pressure. \n \n"
				+ "Reduce sodium intake by: \n"
				+ "• Read the Nutrition Facts label for information on the sodium content of foods and purchase foods that are low in sodium. \n"
				+ "• Consume more fresh foods and fewer processed foods that are high in sodium. \n"
				+ "• Eat more home-prepared foods, where you have more control over sodium, and use little or no salt or saltcontaining seasonings"
				+ " when cooking or eating foods. \n + • When eating at restaurants, ask that salt not be added"
				+ " to your food or order lower sodium options, if available. ";

		nutrientDescriptions[12] = // => zinc
		"Zinc is a nutrient that people need to stay healthy. Zinc is found in cells throughout the body. It helps the immune system fight"
				+ " off invading bacteria and viruses. The body also needs zinc to make proteins and DNA, the genetic material in all cells. During pregnancy,"
				+ " infancy, and childhood, the body needs zinc to grow and develop properly. Zinc also helps wounds heal and is important for proper senses of"
				+ "taste and smell. \n\nZinc is found in a wide variety of foods. You can get recommended amounts of zinc by eating a variety of foods including the "
				+ "following: Oysters, which are the best source of zinc; Red meat, poultry, seafood such as crab and lobsters, and fortified breakfast cereals,"
				+ " which are also good sources of zinc; Beans, nuts, whole grains, and dairy products, which provide some zinc.";

		nutrientDescriptions[13] = // => vitamin c
		"Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient found in some foods. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant, helping to "
				+ "protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy."
				+ " People are also exposed to free radicals in the environment from cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet light from the sun."
				+ " The body also needs vitamin C to make collagen, a protein required to help wounds heal. In addition, vitamin C improves the absorption of "
				+ "iron from plant-based foods and helps the immune system work properly to protect the body from disease.\n\n Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C. "
				+ "You can get recommended amounts of vitamin C by eating a variety of foods including the following: Citrus fruits (such as oranges and grapefruit) and their juices"
				+ ", as well as red and green pepper and kiwifruit, which have a lot of vitamin C. Other fruits and vegetables—such as broccoli, strawberries, cantaloupe,"
				+ " baked potatoes, and tomatoes—which also have vitamin C. Some foods and beverages that are fortified with vitamin C. To find out if vitamin C has been "
				+ "added to a food product, check the product labels. The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking. Steaming or microwaving "
				+ "may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually eaten raw.";

		nutrientDescriptions[14] = // => vitamin d
		"Vitamin D is a nutrient found in some foods that is needed for health and to maintain strong bones. It does so by helping the body absorb "
				+ "calcium (one of bone's main building blocks) from food and supplements. People who get too little vitamin D may develop soft, thin, and brittle bones,"
				+ " a condition known as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. \n\nVitamin D is important to the body in many other ways as well. "
				+ "Muscles need it to move, for example, nerves need it to carry messages between the brain and every body part, and the immune system needs "
				+ "vitamin D to fight off invading bacteria and viruses. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D "
				+ "is found in cells throughout the body. \n\nVery few foods naturally have vitamin D. Fortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in American diets."
				+ " Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel are among the best sources. Beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks provide small amounts."
				+ " Mushrooms provide some vitamin D. In some mushrooms that are newly available in stores, the vitamin D content is being boosted by exposing these mushrooms to ultraviolet light."
				+ " Almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with 400 IU of vitamin D per quart. But foods made from milk, like cheese and ice cream, "
				+ " are usually not fortified. Vitamin D is added to many breakfast cereals and to some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and soy beverages;"
				+ " check the labels.";

		nutrientDescriptions[15] = // => vitamin b6
		"";

		nutrientDescriptions[16] = // => vitamin b12
		"Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that helps keep the body's nerve and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. " +
		"Vitamin B12 also helps prevent a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia that makes people tired and weak. Two steps are required for the " +
		"body to absorb vitamin B12 from food. First, hydrochloric acid in the stomach separates vitamin B12 from the protein to which vitamin B12 " +
		"is attached in food. After this, vitamin B12 combines with a protein made by the stomach called intrinsic factor and is absorbed by the body. " +
		"Some people have pernicious anemia, a condition where they cannot make intrinsic factor. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 " +
		"from all foods and dietary supplements. \n\n Vitamin B12 is found naturally in a wide variety of animal foods and is added to some fortified foods. " +
		"Plant foods have no vitamin B12 unless they are fortified. You can get recommended amounts of vitamin B12 by eating a variety of foods including " +
		"the following: Beef liver and clams, which are the best sources of vitamin B12. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and other dairy products, " +
		"which also contain vitamin B12. Some breakfast cereals, nutritional yeasts and other food products that are fortified with vitamin B12. " +
		" To find out if vitamin B12 has been added to a food product, check the product labels.";

		nutrientDescriptions[20] = // => saturated fats
		"The body uses some saturated fatty acids for physiological and structural functions, but it makes "
				+ "more than enough to meet those needs. People therefore have no dietary requirement for saturated "
				+ "fatty acids. A strong body of evidence indicates that higher intake of most dietary saturated fatty "
				+ "acids is associated with higher levels of blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) "
				+ "cholesterol. Higher total and LDL cholesterol levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. \n \n"
				+ "Consuming less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids and replacing them with "
				+ "monounsaturated and/or polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with low blood cholesterol levels, "
				+ "and therefore a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.Oils that are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids "
				+ "include canola, olive, and saflower oils. Oils that are good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids "
				+ "include soybean, corn, and cottonseed oils. ";

		nutrientDescriptions[21] = // => cholesterol
		"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that's found in animal-based foods such as meats, poultry, egg yolks, and whole"
				+ " milks. Do you remember the other type of fat that is found in animal-based products? That's right — saturated fat."
				+ "The Recommendation The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 recommend that individuals consume less than 300 milligrams"
				+ " (mg) of cholesterol each day. So, when you follow the tips to reduce your saturated fat intake, in most cases, you will "
				+ "be reducing your dietary cholesterol intake at the same time. For example, if you switch to low-fat and fat-free dairy products,"
				+ " you will reduce your intake of both saturated fat and cholesterol.";
